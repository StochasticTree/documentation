# StochTree Python API Demo

The following demos showcase (some of) the functionality and output of the `stochtree` python package. 

1. [Supervised Learning](supervised_learning.ipynb): using `BARTModel()` for classic supervised learning tasks
2. [Causal Inference](causal_inference.ipynb): using `BCFModel()` for causal effect estimation
3. [Heteroskedastic Supervised Learning](heteroskedastic_supervised_learning.ipynb): using `BARTModel()` for supervised learning tasks with heteroskedasticity (covariate-dependent variance)
4. [Multivariate Treatment Causal Inference](multivariate_treatment_causal_inference.ipynb): using `BCFModel()` for causal effect estimation with a multivariate (continuous) treatment variable
5. [Model Serialization](serialization.ipynb): saving and reloading `stochtree` models via JSON
6. [Internal Tree Inspection](tree_inspection.ipynb): inspecting the trees in a sampled `stochtree` forest
