# Advanced StochTree Vignettes

While the R and Python package documentation contains ample documentation and examples, 
`stochtree`'s origin in the world of academic decision tree research means it is 
actively used to develop novel algorithms and applications. 
This section includes in-depth tutorials on how to implement new methods using stochtree, 
with an R and Python version for each vignette.

Current advanced vignettes include:

1. Using `stochtree` for Regression Discontinuity Design ([R](R/rdd.html), [Python](Python/rdd.html))
2. Using `stochtree` for Instrumental Variables Analysis ([R](R/iv.html), [Python](Python/iv.html))
