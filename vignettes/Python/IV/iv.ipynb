    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider a causal inference problem with a binary treatment and a binary outcome where there is unobserved confounding, but an exogenous instrument is available (also binary). This problem will require a number of extensions to the basic BART model, all of which can be implemented straightforwardly as Gibbs samplers using `stochtree`. We'll go through all of the model fitting steps in quite a lot of detail here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To be concrete, suppose we wish to measure the effect of receiving a flu vaccine on the probability of getting the flu. Individuals who opt to get a flu shot differ in many ways from those that don't, and these lifestyle differences presumably also affect their respective chances of getting the flu. Consequently, comparing the percentage of individuals who get the flu in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups does not give a clear picture of the vaccine efficacy. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, a so-called encouragement design can be implemented, where some individuals are selected at random to be given some extra incentive to get a flu shot (free clinics at the workplace or a personalized reminder, for example). Studying the impact of this randomized encouragement allows us to tease apart the impact of the vaccine from the confounding factors, at least to some extent. This exact problem has been considered several times in the literature, starting with McDonald, Hiu, and Tierny (1992) with follow-on analysis by Hirano et. al. (2000), Richardson and Robins (2011), and Imbens and Rubin (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis here follows the Bayesian nonparametric approach described in the supplement to Hahn, Murray, and Manolopoulou (2016)."

    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $V$ denote the treatment variable (as in \"vaccine\"). Let $Y$ denote the response variable (getting the flu), $Z$ denote the instrument (encouragement or reminder to get a flu shot), and $X$ denote an additional observable covariate (for instance, patient age).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, let $S$ denote the so-called *principal strata*, which is an exhaustive characterization of how individuals' might be affected by the encouragement regarding the flu shot. Some people will get a flu shot no matter what: these are the *always takers* (a). Some people will not get the flu shot no matter what: these are the *never takers* (n). For both always-takers and never-takers, the randomization of the encouragement is irrelevant and our data set contains no always takers who skipped the vaccine and no never takers who got the vaccine and so the treatment effect of the vaccine in these groups is fundamentally non-identifiable. \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, we also have *compliers* (c): folks who would not have gotten the shot but for the fact that they were encouraged to do so. These are the people about whom our randomized encouragement provides some information, because they are precisely the ones that have been randomized to treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we could have *defiers* (d): contrarians who who were planning on getting the shot, but -- upon being reminded -- decided not to! For our analysis we will do the usual thing of assuming that there are no defiers. And because we are going to simulate our data, we can make sure that this assumption is true."

    "## The causal diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal diagram for this model can be expressed as follows. Here we are considering one confounder and moderator variable ($X$), which is the patient's age. In our data generating process (which we know because this is a simulation demonstration) higher age will make it more likely that a person is an always taker or complier and less likely that they are a nevertaker, which in turn has an effect on flu risk. We stipulate here that always takers are at lower risk and never takers at higher risk. Simultaneously, age has an increasing and then decreasing direct effect on flu risk; very young and very old are at higher risk, while young and middle age adults are at lower risk. In this DGP the flu efficacy has a multiplicative effect, reducing flu risk as a fixed proportion of baseline risk -- accordingly, the treatment effect (as a difference) is nonlinear in Age (for each principal stratum).\n",

    "The biggest question about this graph concerns the dashed red arrow from the putative instrument $Z$ to the outcome (flu). I say \"putative\" because if that dashed red arrow is there, then technically $Z$ is not a valid instrument. The assumption/assertion that there is no dashed red arrow is called the \"exclusion restriction\". In this vignette, we will explore what sorts of inferences are possible if we remain agnostic about the presence or absence of that dashed red arrow."

    "## Potential outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two relevant potential outcomes in an instrumental variables analysis, corresponding to the causal effect of the instrument on the treatment and the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome. In this example, that is the effect of the reminder/encouragement on vaccine status and the effect of the vaccine itself on the flu. The notation is $V(Z)$ and $Y(V(Z),Z)$ respectively, so that we have six distinct random variables: $V(0)$, $V(1)$, $Y(0,0)$, $Y(1,0)$, $Y(0,1)$ and $Y(1,1)$. The problem -- sometimes called the *fundamental problem of causal inference* -- is that some of these random variables can never be seen simultaneously, they are observationally mutually exclusive. For this reason, it may be helpful to think about causal inference as a missing data problem, as depicted in the following table."

    "With a valid exclusion restriction the three black curves would all be the same. With no exclusion restriction, as we have here, the direct effect of $Z$ on $Y$ (the vaccine reminder on flu status) makes it so these three treatment effects are different. Specifically, the $ITT_c$ compares getting the vaccine *and* getting the reminder to not getting the vaccine *and* not getting the reminder. When both things have risk reducing impacts, we see a larger risk reduction over all values of $X$. Meanwhile, the two LATE effects compare the isolated impact of the vaccine among people that got the reminder and those that didn't, respectively. Here, not getting the reminder makes the vaccine more effective because the risk reduction is as a fraction of baseline risk, and the reminder reduces baseline risk in our DGP. \n",
